# This problem is based off of example 2
# Modify it so that it also tracks a person's age and a quote
# Allow any of these to be set with a hash as well, but the block should overwrite the hash
#
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# artist = Person.new :name => 'Prince' do |person|
#   person.age   = 47age
#   person.quote = "Why don't you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?"
# end
#
# artist.name   # => "Prince"
# artist.age    # => 47
#
# artist.name = 'The Artist Formarly Known As Prince'
# artist.age  = 1999
#
# artist.name   # => "The Artist Formarly Known As Prince"
# artist.age    # => 1999
#
# artist.reinit
#
# artist.name   # => "The Artist Formarly Known As Prince"
# artist.age    # => 47


class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :quote #getters and setters for name age and uote

#passing a reference to the block to a method.
  def initialize(hash, &block)
    @name = hash[:name]
    @age = hash[:age]
    @quote = hash[:quote]

  if block
    @block = block
    block.call(self)

  def reinit
